# TORC coding challenge

This is the code challenge issued by torq. This was what I was able to do in 4 hours od development.

## DISCLAIMER

If you want to run the specs just do

`bundle exec spec`

You'll see that there are some test that are not passsing. I loaded the scenarios provided by the exercice but I was not able the correct the rounding issue. I decided not to continue with the exercice since I went over the time limit.
